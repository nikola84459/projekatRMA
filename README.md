Description:
This project involves the development of an Android mobile application using the Java programming language. The application is designed for purchasing airline tickets.

The user can enter details about their trip (departure location, arrival location, date, etc.), and if flights matching the entered information are found, the user can select the desired outbound and return flights. Afterward, the user enters necessary personal information to complete the reservation.

Once personal details are entered, the user provides payment card information to successfully purchase the airline ticket.

The user can view completed reservations. Additionally, when the user is out of network coverage, they can still view reservations as they are stored locally in an SQLite database on the device.

The user also has the option to check-in for a flight through the app by selecting the check-in option and entering travel document details.
